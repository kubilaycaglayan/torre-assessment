1. Planning
  - 08:00 (UTC +3) Receive the Technical Test.
  - Experiment with API endpoints to understand how to use them.
  - Choose React SPA to create the project.
  - 09:00 Come up with an idea.

### ðŸ’¡ Idea
Given a group of user ids, select one user to find the most relevant job opening for the one.
And then compare the selected user with others.
Comparison will be on the basis of pointing users with their abilities.
Pointing will be representational for the MVP. Basicall we can give 1 point for every presented skill.
### ðŸ’¡ Idea

  - Check dependencies
  - Start building
  - Make it work
  - Make it right
  - Make it fast
  - Make it pretty
  - Check the assessment requirements again
